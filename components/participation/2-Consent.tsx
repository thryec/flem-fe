          <p className="indent-8 text-justify mb-8">
            Some participants may find answering personal questions about
            sensitive topics (behavior, medical conditions, or lifestyle) to be
            a bit uncomfortable. As with any mode of electronic participation,
            there is always a small risk of loss of privacy. Weâ€™ll always do
            everything we can to protect your data, but no app or study can ever
            be perfectly safe from hacking. See our Privacy Policy and Data
            Security Measures, available in the app and on the web, for more
            information.

            Participation does not in any way substitute for professional
            medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment that your doctor or other
            healthcare provider may give you. Always ask the advice of your
            healthcare provider if you have any questions about a medical
            condition. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay in
            seeking care because of something you have read as part of this
            study. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your
            doctor or dial 911 immediately.
